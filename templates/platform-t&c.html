                        fees, disbursement of payments, and issuance of vouchers as incentives. As a next-generation
                        Online Marketplace and AI-Assisted Practice Management Platform (PMP) system, 998-P is designed
                        to transform how professionals across key service sectors operate and deliver value. At its
                        core, it offers a cloud-based, modular, and scalable ecosystem that combines a powerful PMP
                        infrastructure with a dynamic service exchange environment, allowing professionals to manage
                        operations efficiently while connecting with potential clients. Operating on a
                        Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, the platform delivers robust and intelligent workflow
                        automation tools to assist in complex task execution, professional compliance, collaborative
                        team management, client interaction, and real-time progress tracking, all through an integrated

                        excellence by supporting both on-platform and hybrid work modes, while also providing
                        credential-based access to maintain regulatory alignment and service integrity. Each user group
                        functions within a customized PMP environment, referred to as "Drive:\", with common modules
                        like virtual meetings and document rooms shared across drives, and other modules tailored for
                        specific professional domains. The Company may notify users of significant changes to Services
                        through emails, notifications, or other communications.</p>

                    <p>998-P may integrate third-party services (such as payment gateways, cloud storage, communication
                        tools, or government APIs). Use of such services shall be governed by the third-party's terms,
                        and 998-P disclaims responsibility for their performance, data practices, or downtime.</p>

                    <p>998-P reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any module, feature, or service at
                        any time without liability, provided that such changes shall not materially deprive You of core
                        subscribed services.</p>

                    <p><strong>User Data & Privacy:</strong> By using the Platform, you consent to the collection,

                    <h4>2. Disclaimer</h4>
                    <p>998-P acts solely as an intermediary when connecting Professionals with clients and is not
                        responsible for the conduct, performance, or obligations of Professionals or clients. However,
                        in the event of any issues or disputes, our committees will review the matter in accordance with
                        applicable law, with the laws of the Republic of India being paramount and the courts in Mumbai
                        having jurisdiction. While the Platform offers AI-assisted tools and outputs to support
                        professional work, AI is intended to assist, not replace, human judgment or expertise; all
                        outputs, advice, or suggestions generated by the AI should be cross-checked by the professional.
                        AI-generated documents should not be treated as legal advice or certified compliance output.</p>

                    <p>Efforts are made to ensure functionality, but the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any
                        content on the Platform is not guaranteed. Outputs may be incomplete, outdated, or legally
                        insufficient, and that 998-P bears NO LIABILITY for reliance without professional validation.
                        Third-party content may also be available on the Platform, for which 998-P disclaims
                        responsibility. The Platform may take disciplinary actions in accordance with its rules and
                        regulations, always within the boundaries of applicable law. If subscribed modules are used,
                        they are designed to assist with tasks and save time; however, users must cross-check outputs,
                        as ultimate responsibility remains with the professional.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>The license is intended to support and enhance professional work, not replace professional
                        judgment or bypass legal or regulatory obligations. Any violation of these restrictions may

                        to any legal remedies available under the laws of the Republic of India.</p>

                    <h4>4. Payments and Refunds</h4>
                    <p>Until such time as modules or services on the 998-P Platform are offered free of charge, no
                        payment is required. However, once any module, subscription, or service becomes chargeable, all
                        applicable fees must be paid in full prior to access or use of such modules. Users who purchase

                        render it non-refundable. Eligible refunds will be processed through wallet credit or bank
                        refund, as may be selected by the users.</p>

                        exclusive of applicable taxes (GST, cess, etc.) and must be borne by the user.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, vouchers issued by 998-P are fully redeemable and may either be applied toward
                        future module purchases or other Platform services, as determined by 998-P. Please note that

                    <p>998-P will review all claims in accordance with applicable law and may remove or restrict access
                        to allegedly infringing content as necessary, without assuming liability for any content posted
                        by Professionals.</p>

                    <h4>7. Indemnification and Limitation of Liability</h4>
                    <p>Professionals agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless 998-P, its affiliates, officers,
                        employees, agents, and partners from and against any claims, demands, losses, liabilities,
                        damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating
                        to:</p>

                    <ul class="ms-4">
                        <li>Any breach of these Terms & Conditions, the Privacy Policy, or any other applicable policies
                            of 998-P;</li>
                        <li>Any violation of applicable laws, regulations, or the rights of third parties;</li>
                        <li>Any unauthorized, improper, or wrongful use of the Platform, including misuse of Platform

                        <li>Any reliance on AI-generated outputs, advice, or suggestions without proper professional
                            verification or cross-checking.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>While the Platform provides AI-assisted tools and outputs to support professional work, AI is
                        intended solely to assist and not replace human judgment, expertise, or decision-making.
                        Professionals remain fully responsible for verifying, validating, and cross-checking all
                        outputs, suggestions, or recommendations provided by AI before acting upon them.</p>

                    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, 998-P, its officers, employees, and agents shall not be
                        liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages arising
                        from the use of the Platform, including but not limited to errors or omissions in AI-generated
                        content, disruptions to services, or reliance on professional outputs.</p>

                    <p>The Platform may implement disciplinary or remedial measures in accordance with its rules and
                        regulations, always within the boundaries of applicable law. Users acknowledge that subscribing
                        to Platform modules is intended to assist in completing tasks efficiently and saving time;
                        however, ultimate responsibility for professional decisions and outputs rests entirely with the
                        Professional.</p>

                    <h4>8. Term & Termination</h4>

                        <li>Any outstanding fees, payments, or other obligations owed by You to 998-P shall become
                            immediately due and payable;</li>
                        <li>You must cease all use of the Platform immediately, including any access to AI-assisted
                            tools, modules, or proprietary features.</li>
                    </ul>

                        jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p>998-P explicitly reserves right to suspend any user access if subscription fees remain unpaid or
                        if abusive activity is detected which may include spam, fraud or any kind of misuse.</p>
