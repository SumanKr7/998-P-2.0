                    <p>We collect, store, and process Your Personal Information and User Data only where a lawful basis
                        exists, such as Your explicit consent or where it is necessary for Our legitimate interests in

                        illegal, or prohibited activities, and to ensure compliance with Our obligations under law.</p>
                    <p>Importantly, 998-P does not sell, rent, or lease Your Personal Information to third parties, nor
                        do We use Your queries, files, or documents to train or re-train any AI systems or models. Any
                        data You provide is only ephemerally processed to generate the requested outputs or services,
                        and Our systems do not permanently retain or repurpose this information for model training or
                        commercial exploitation.</p>
                    <p>Where We engage trusted third-party service providers or API partners to support the functioning
                        of the Platform, we ensure that they meet industry-standard privacy safeguards and do not use
                        Your data to improve their own systems or models. Your files, prompts, outputs, and professional
                        information remain fully confidential and are not monitored or accessed by Us, except where
                        strictly necessary to maintain or secure the Platform.</p>
                    <p>By using the 998-P Platform, you acknowledge that Your information is collected and processed
                        solely for enabling the delivery, enhancement, and lawful administration of the Services and not
                        for any secondary or unrelated commercial purposes.</p>

                        <li>Your explicit consent;</li>
                        <li>The necessity of processing for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual
                            obligations;</li>
                        <li>Compliance with legal obligations;</li>
                        <li>Legitimate interests pursued by the Platform, such as improving services, ensuring security,

                    <p>The Platform integrates AI-powered functionalities to assist Users in drafting, analysis, and
                        process automation. Such tools may process User Data ephemerally to generate outputs and do not

                        handled in compliance with strict data confidentiality protocols, and no User Data is exposed to
                        third-party AI providers beyond what is technically required for the requested operation.</p>

                        disproportionate effort.</p>
                    <p>Due to the way certain services and systems are maintained, residual copies of deleted Personal
                        Information may persist in backup systems for a limited period before permanent erasure. To

                    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, Your Personal
                        Information may be transferred to the successor entity subject to the terms of this Policy. We
                        may also disclose Your information if required to comply with a court order or legal directive,

                        the purposes outlined in this Policy, including the pursuit of Our legitimate business interests

                    <ul class="ms-4">
                        <li>Certain Personal Information may be retained where necessary to protect Our legitimate
                            business interests, including but not limited to fraud detection, prevention, and security
                            enhancement.</li>

                        <li>Due to the technical nature of data storage systems, residual copies of Your Personal
                            Information may persist in backup or archival systems for a limited period, even after
                            deletion from active servers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Survey Data, by contrast, may be anonymized and retained in aggregated form beyond the retention

                        including statistical analysis, improving and enhancing the Services, research, and generating
                        insights to better tailor offerings for Professionals on the platform, without linking back to

                        Platform.</p>

                    <h4>12. Opt-Out of Communications</h4>

                    <h4>14. Voucher and Registration Terms</h4>
                    <p>Each Professional who completes the survey shall be eligible to receive a voucher valued at INR
                        5000. These vouchers shall remain redeemable for a period of three (3) years from the date on
                        which official professional registration numbers are rolled out (the "Effective Date"). Prior to
                        the rollout of official registration numbers, Professionals shall be provided with Temporary
                        Registration Numbers along with the corresponding voucher details, which shall be communicated
                        via email.</p>
                    <p>The redemption of vouchers shall be governed by separate terms and conditions, which shall be
                        communicated to Professionals at the time of issuance.</p>
                    <p>To facilitate voucher issuance or redemption, limited Personal Information such as your name,
                        registration number, and email address may be shared with authorized voucher partners or payment
                        gateways. These entities are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations and are
                        prohibited from using such data for any other purpose.</p>

                    <h4>15. Data Security</h4>
                    <p>We implement robust security measures to safeguard data from unauthorized access, alteration,
                        disclosure, or destruction. These measures include periodic internal reviews of our data
                        collection, storage, and processing practices, along with the use of appropriate encryption
                        protocols to secure systems where personal information is maintained. In addition, we have
                        adopted suitable technical, electronic, and administrative safeguards designed to prevent
                        unauthorized access and to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of your personal
                        information. Our safeguards are proportionate to the sensitivity of the data we collect,
                        process, and retain, while also reflecting the prevailing state of technological development and
                        industry standards. Although we adhere to widely accepted security practices to protect personal
                        information during both transmission and storage, you acknowledge and understand that no method
                        of transmitting or storing data over the Internet can be entirely risk-free or guaranteed as
                        100% secure.</p>

                    <h4>16. Anonymity and Confidentiality of Survey Data</h4>
                    <p>Survey Data collected from Professionals shall be analysed in anonymized form wherever feasible
                        to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Individual responses will not be disclosed in any manner
                        that identifies a Professional without their explicit consent, thereby safeguarding the
                        anonymity of all survey participants.</p>

                    <h4>17. Data Breach Notification</h4>
                    <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach or unauthorized access affecting your Personal
                        Information, 998-P will take all reasonable steps to contain the incident and notify affected
                        individuals and authorities as required by applicable laws.</p>

                    <h4>18. User Rights</h4>
                    <p>Professionals retain several rights concerning their Personal Information and Survey Data. They
                        have the right to access the Personal Information maintained by the Company and may request
                        corrections or deletions of any inaccurate or incomplete information. Additionally,
                        Professionals may withdraw their consent for processing of Personal Information, keeping in mind
                        that such withdrawal may impact their ability to continue using certain features of the
                        Platform. Professionals may also request the anonymization of their Survey Data, ensuring that
                        their responses can still contribute to aggregated analyses while maintaining personal
                        confidentiality.</p>
