                  <p class="two-column-text">The idea of 998-P was born from observing a persistent struggle in the
                     professional services landscape. Across domains — Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries,
                     Lawyers, Insolvency Professionals, Valuers, and other specialists — professionals were working
                     tirelessly, yet were often overworked, underpaid, and under-supported despite their talent and
                     expertise. <br>We saw professionals wrestling with fragmented tools, manual processes, repetitive
                     tasks, and unclear client expectations. Many lacked the digital infrastructure to scale their
                     practice, losing time on administrative chaos rather than focusing on their core expertise.
                     Moreover, strict codes of conduct restricted them from advertising or promoting their services,
                     while larger firms, armed with technology, continued to take the bigger share of opportunities.
                     <br>On the other side of the table, service seekers — businesses, startups, and individuals — were
                     facing their own challenges. How do they find a dependable, competent professional for their
                     specific need? How can they ensure transparent pricing, timely delivery, and quality assurance? Too
                     often, they were left frustrated by miscommunication, missed deadlines, or sub-standard work.
                     <br>998-P was conceived to solve both sides of the equation. <br>We envisioned a next-generation ERP
                     platform that not only helps professionals manage their practice smarter but also creates a digital
                     marketplace to connect them directly with verified clients. AI-driven tools eliminate repetitive
                     manual work — drafting, compliance tracking, calculations, and research — while ensuring accuracy,
                     speed, and cost-efficiency. Our goal is to empower professionals to deliver their best work while
                     enabling clients to get quality services, transparent processes, and fair pricing. <br>At its
                     heart, 998-P is more than software — it’s an ecosystem designed to bridge technology and human
                     expertise, leveling the playing field so that every professional, whether solo or in a small firm,
                     can compete with the best.
