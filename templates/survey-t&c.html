                    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("T&C") govern your participation in surveys conducted by 998-P
                        ("Platform", "we", "us", or "our") for professionals ("Professional", "you"). By participating
                        in any survey, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these T&C.</p>

                    <h4>2. Participation</h4>
                    <p>Participation in the survey is entirely voluntary, and you may choose to withdraw at any time
                        without consequence. Surveys are designed to gather feedback, insights, and opinions to improve
                        the Platform and enhance the experience for all users. Professionals are expected to provide
                        honest and accurate responses, and any misrepresentation or false information may result in the
                        invalidation of participation.</p>

                    <h4>3. Use of Survey Data</h4>
                    <p>The information collected through surveys may be used by 998-P for research, analysis, service
                        enhancement, and operational decision-making. Survey data may be aggregated or anonymized to
                        ensure identities are protected before any analysis, reporting, or publication. The findings
                        derived from surveys may inform platform functionality, guide the introduction of new features,
                        or support strategic business decisions.</p>

                    <h4>4. Privacy and Confidentiality</h4>
                    <p>All survey responses will be treated with strict confidentiality. Wherever feasible, survey
                        responses will remain anonymous, and identifying information will not be disclosed outside the
                        Platform team. Access to raw survey data is restricted solely to authorized personnel. 998-P
                        implements reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data from
                        unauthorized access, misuse, or loss, though absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

                    <h4>5. Data Retention</h4>
                    <p>Survey data may be retained for as long as necessary to analyze trends, improve services, or
                        comply with legal obligations. Personally identifiable information, where collected, will be
                        anonymized or removed once it is no longer required for these stated purposes.</p>

                    <h4>6. Consent</h4>
                    <p>By participating in the survey, you provide consent to the collection, processing, and use of
                        your data as described herein. You may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the Platform;
                        however, previously collected anonymized data may continue to be used for analysis.</p>

                    <h4>7. Intellectual Property</h4>
                    <p>All feedback, suggestions, and insights you provide through the survey become the property of
                        998-P. By submitting responses, you grant 998-P a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
                        analyze, and publish survey data for research, development, and operational purposes.</p>

                    <h4>8. Voucher Incentive</h4>
                    <p>Professionals who complete the survey are eligible to receive vouchers worth INR 5000. These
                        vouchers can be redeemed within a period of three (3) years from the date the professional
                        registration number rollout begins. Temporary registration numbers will be issued to survey
                        participants along with an email specifying the voucher details. 998-P reserves the right to
                        validate entries before disbursing incentives. Redemption of the voucher is subject to the
                        conditions outlined in the email and must comply with the Platform's terms for voucher usage.
                    </p>

                    <p>Vouchers are non-transferable, non-exchangeable, and cannot be redeemed for cash or combined with
                        other offers. Any attempt to sell, duplicate, or misuse vouchers may result in disqualification
                        and forfeiture of the reward.</p>

                    <h4>9. Limitation of Liability</h4>
                    <p>Participation in the survey is undertaken at your own discretion. While 998-P takes all
                        reasonable measures to protect your data, the Platform cannot guarantee absolute security and is
                        not responsible for any unintended disclosure of survey responses due to factors beyond our
                        control.</p>

                    <h4>10. Survey Termination</h4>
                    <p>998-P reserves the right to suspend, modify, or cancel the survey at any time, including the
                        incentive program, without prior notice, due to technical issues, fraud, or circumstances beyond
                        its control. In such cases, no compensation or alternative voucher will be provided.</p>

                    <h4>11. Modifications</h4>
                    <p>998-P reserves the right to modify these T&C at any time. These T& C may be modified at any time,
                        in the event that a Professional does not agree with any modification, they may choose to
                        withdraw from the survey. For example, if the survey form has already been submitted prior to
                        changes in the Terms, the Professional may request that their submission be discarded or
                        excluded. It is the responsibility of Professionals to review any updates carefully, as the
                        modified Terms will govern all subsequent use of the Platform and its services.</p>

                    <h4>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h4>
                    <p>These T&C are governed by the laws of the Republic of India. Any disputes arising from
                        participation in the survey shall first be attempted to be resolved amicably through
                        communication with the Platform. If resolution is not achieved, disputes shall fall under the
                        exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Mumbai.</p>
